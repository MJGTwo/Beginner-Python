# Beginner-Python
My old highschool asked me to write up a tutorial for Python for CS1. This is my attempt at doing that. I have a lesson plan written out that I will be using to guide me.

I'd like to credit Sibel Adali, a Computer Science professor at RPI, for everything I do here. I undergrad-TA'ed under her for a year for CS1 and another semester and a summer under different professors. I feel that her teaching style helps make learning fun and I try to keep that feeling as I write this.
