# Welcome to Python!

This is meant to be a crash course in learning Computer Science with Python. The following outline is what I intend to show you how to do:

* What is programming?
* Math in programming
* Functions
 * Using functions and making functions
* Data types
 * Strings, integers, floating points ... etc
* Comparing data
* Accessing files
* Programming structure
 * loops (for and while), if-statements ... etc
* Basic data structures
 * Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries ... etc
* Libraries and Modules (aka using other people's code)
* Classes
* Searching
* Sorting
* Recursion
* Coding after this introduction

Let's get started. Below is a Table of Content:

* [Setting up Python](/setup/setup.md)
 * [Getting an IDE](/setup/ide.md)
* [Back to Math Class](/math/math.md)
