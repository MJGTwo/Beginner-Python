Here is a list of keywords that are referenced in this tutorial. Please note that they will not be capitalized because how they are typed matters in Python.

* `print`
 * `print` tells Python that everything following `print` on the same line will be displayed in the console of Python. The console is a way the computer can communicate with the user.
* `return`
 * Imagine you have a function that is a box. There is a hole in the box that you put things inside and there is another hole that gives you the output. When the box is made, it has all sorts of operations going on to modify the input that is given to it. It also has to be told when to give you the result. So you tell it to `return` the output.
