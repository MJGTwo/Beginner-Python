# Data in Computer Science

Everything in a computer is stored in binary. The computer also stores what type of data is stored in that place in memory. These are the following types of data:

* int
* float
* char(acters)
* string

In other programming languages, there are more data types. Those languages tend to be a more low-level programming language. This means that the language can interact with the computer hardware more easily than another language. Python is a high-level language and cannot do that as easily.

## What are char and string?

Python blurs the line between the type char and the type string. A char is a single item of data that represents a symbol such as the symbols on a computer keyboard. Examples are `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, and all the special symbols like `%,!@#$` and so on.

A string is a collection of characters. The name comes from the collection being a * **string** of characters*. In languages like C and C++ use " (double quotes) to contain a string, like `"this"` and use ' (single quotes) to contain a char, like `'t' 'h' 'i' 's'`. However, in Python this does not matter and you can use whichever you want `'1234'` and `"1"` are acceptable.
