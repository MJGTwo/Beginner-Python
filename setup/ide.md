# What is an IDE?

IDE stands for *Integrated Development Environment*. In more low level programming languages (C++, C, etc), you will use a text editor (think word processor like Word, Pages, or Google Doc) and a compiler in a terminal. IDEs take the text editor and compiler and put them together. Examples of this are XCode and Visual Studio.

Python is interpreted instead of compiled, which means that it is simplified into C++, compiled, and ran. I **highly** recommend using Wing101 as a IDE for Python for first time users. [You can download it here](http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101). You are welcome to search for a different IDE of your choice online.
