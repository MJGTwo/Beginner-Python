# Data structures

In this section, we will go over the major data structures of Python. There are other data structures out there but we will not be going that far. If you are still curious after this introduction to Python, explore the C++ language and find a good reference for data structures.

## What are 'data structures'?

Data structures are, in the most general and simplest terms, a thing that has other things inside of it. The point is to store data in a efficient way to access, add, edit, and delete the data. Some take more time to use but take up less space in memory, some are the other way around.

The structures we will be talking about are the following: list, tuple, sets, and dictionaries.
