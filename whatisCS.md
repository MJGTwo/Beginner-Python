# What is Computer Science (CS)?

To overly simplify things, engineering is to physics as computer science is to math. By that I mean computer science is applied math, however that is a gross understatement of the full range of things that computer science is capable of doing in the world.

Computer science also includes the study of the hardware and understanding of why things work the way they do. Not down to the physics of why the transistor works (a transistor is a glorified switch that allows electricity to flow through it or not flow through it) but logic based on simple components that have simple logic-actions.
